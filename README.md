Artificial Intelligence Cullen McCaleb Fall 2024

This repository contains all assignments completed for my reinfocement learning class, CS131. 
These include the following:

ann: Trains an artifical neural network to classify types of Iris plants, 
based on Fisher's Iris Database.

binary_tree: Simulates a vacuum robot using a binary tree.

genetic_algorithms: Uses a genetic algorithm to solve the knapsack problem, 
generating a chromosome to solve the prompt based on maximizing a fitness function.

pancake_problem: Solves the pancake problem by framing it as a search problem, 
using either an A* or UCB algorithm depending on the user's input.

radar_trace: Uses Na√Øve Bayesian classification to analyze speed consistency and 
classify test tracks as either birds or airplanes based on training data.

sudoku: Solves a given sudoku puzzle by framing it as a constrain satisfaction 
problem.
