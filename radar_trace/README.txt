Artificial Intelligence Assignment 5: Naive Bayesian Classification

Name: Cullen McCaleb
Date: 11/27

The additional classifcation feature I chose was speed consistency, or how 
much the speed varies whithin a 6 second time interval. I chose this second
feature because birds should have higher variability in changing speed, while
plans should have more consistency. The additional feature is implemented in
the calculate_speed_consistency function.
